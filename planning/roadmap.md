# AI Portfolio Roadmap – Carlos Sepulveda

## Phase 0 — Foundations (Week 1–2)
- Set up GitHub profile and portfolio repo
- Establish journaling and planning workflow
- Refresh ML basics (supervised learning, evaluation, overfitting)

## Phase 1 — First LLM Agent (Weeks 2–4)
- Implement AI Log Triage Agent (CLI + FastAPI)
- Generate synthetic or anonymized log data
- Run small experiments on prompt design, context size, and clustering

## Phase 2 — RAG “Docs-to-Copilot” Starter (Month 2)
- Build ingestion + vector index pipeline
- Expose simple API and CLI
- Evaluate grounding quality and hallucinations on a small document corpus

## Phase 3 — Operational ML (Month 3)
- Implement predictive maintenance/ticket routing ML model
- Compare classic ML (e.g., XGBoost, logistic regression) vs. LLM-based classification
- Document experiment setup and metrics

## Phase 4 — Research Track (Months 3–9)
- Select 1–2 concrete research questions, e.g.:
  - “How effective are LLM-based agents at triaging production logs vs. baseline heuristics?”
  - “How does model size impact grounding quality in small-scale RAG systems?”
- Perform literature review
- Design experiments and evaluation metrics
- Write and iterate on a paper draft (target: arXiv / workshop)

## Phase 5 — Graduate School Preparation
- Use this repo + paper as key artifacts
- Align personal statement with portfolio projects and research direction
- Coordinate letters of recommendation with managers/mentors
