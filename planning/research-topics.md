# Research Topic Ideas (Rough Notes)

## 1. LLM Agents for Log & Issue Triage
- Problem: Developers spend significant time triaging logs and tickets.
- Idea: Evaluate LLM-based log triage agent vs. simple keyword/regex baselines.
- Metrics: Accuracy of clusterings, time-to-understand, and developer satisfaction.

## 2. Small vs Large Models in RAG for Ops Docs
- Problem: RAG systems used with ops/maintenance docs may not need very large models.
- Idea: Compare small open models vs large API models on factual Q&A over a small corpus.
- Metrics: Exact match, groundedness, hallucination rate.

## 3. Evaluating AI Coding Assistants on Maintenance Tasks
- Problem: Most benchmarks test algorithmic problems, not messy, real-world maintenance.
- Idea: Define a suite of “legacy code maintenance” tasks and measure quality/time with different tools.
- Metrics: Test pass rate, human edit distance, subjective maintainability.

(Add more as you think of them.)
