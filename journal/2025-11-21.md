# Daily Log – 2025-11-21

## 🎯 Goals for Today
- [ ] Begin setting up project environment for the AI Log Triage Agent
- [ ] Get free-tier LLM API access working (OpenRouter + free models)
- [ ] Configure .env variables and integrate them into project
- [ ] Fix Windows / VSCode Python + pip environment issues
- [ ] Test LLM connectivity successfully
- [ ] Align GitHub profile + repo direction with AI/ML portfolio goals

## 🧭 What I Actually Did
✅ 1. Configured Windows + VSCode Python environment

    Installed/confirmed Python installation

    Addressed pip not recognized PATH issue

    Switched to using python -m pip for package installs

    Installed required libraries (e.g., python-dotenv, requests)

    ✅ 2. Created & configured environment variable system

    Added .env file to project root

    Added .gitignore entries to protect private keys (.env, *.env)

    Added OpenRouter API key + free-model variables

    Added new env vars to config.py using load_dotenv()

✅ 3. Built first version of the LLM client

    Implemented llm_client.py with POST request logic

    Confirmed correct headers, API key usage, and endpoint format

    Wired model selection via environment variables

    Ensured correct parsing of API response (choices[0].text)

✅ 4. Created LLM connectivity test

    Added test_llm_connection.py

    Wrote logic to import from src/ai_log_triage/

    Added try/catch for error clarity

    Ran the test and successfully validated connectivity

✅ 5. Finalized GitHub direction for AI portfolio

    Picked hybrid industry/research profile tone

    Selected hybrid repo structure

    Selected both FastAPI + CLI architecture for future support

    Confirmed free-model API strategy for early development

## 🚧 Blockers / Issues
- No major blockers, but need to ensure:

    Python PATH behaves consistently in future shells

    .env remains excluded from GitHub

    Rate limits on free models are monitored during dev

## 🧠 Notes / Ideas
- Consider abstracting multiple model providers (OpenRouter, local models, HF) under one interface (LLMProvider classes).

- Very strong progress — you now have the infrastructure backbone for the entire AI log triage project.

- Tomorrow is a great time to begin Phase 1 log generation + preprocessing module.

## 🔄 Plan for Tomorrow
 - Generate realistic logs for Phase 1 (system logs, app exceptions, stack traces, CI/CD logs)

 - Create /data/sample_logs/ folder with multiple log types

 - Build log_loader.py for reading/parsing logs

 - Begin drafting prompt templates for triage agent

 - Run first full LLM triage pass on sample logs
