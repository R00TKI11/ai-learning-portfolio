# **Daily Log – 2025-02-14**

## **🎯 Goals for Today**

* Continue Phase 1 development of the AI Log Triage Agent
* Integrate and refine FastAPI functionality
* Review, debug, and improve overall project structure
* Generate architecture documentation updates
* Prepare enhancement roadmap for next development phase

---

## **🧭 What I Accomplished Today**

### **1. FastAPI Feature Development**

* Implemented full FastAPI application structure inside `src/ai_log_triage/api`
* Added the following endpoints:

  * `/health` – health check endpoint
  * `/triage` – process uploaded logs via API
  * `/triage/text` – triage raw log text sent via JSON
  * `/models` – report available LLM models configured via environment variables
* Added proper request/response models using Pydantic
* Implemented error handling, validation, and structured response formatting
* Added CORS configuration for future UI integration
* Created a `main.py` entrypoint to launch the API

### **2. CLI Improvements**

* Updated CLI logic to call the new unified triage engine
* Added support for selecting:

  * input file
  * directory mode
  * model selection override
* Improved output formatting to match API output structure

### **3. Enhanced Internal Architecture**

* Refined the code organization for clarity:

  * `llm_client.py` for all model interaction
  * `log_parser.py` for structured log parsing
  * `triage_agent.py` for orchestration and LLM prompts
  * `config.py` for environment variable management
  * `api/` for FastAPI routes and models
* Integrated shared triage pipeline so both CLI and API use the same flow

### **4. Added New Documentation**

* Updated the architecture diagram (Mermaid)
* Expanded README architecture section for clarity
* Added FASTAPI_SUMMARY.md to document endpoints
* Added CONTRIBUTING.md to prepare repo for future collaborators

### **5. Testing & Validation**

* Ran and validated:

  * CLI triage execution
  * All FastAPI endpoints
  * Log parser tests
  * Triage agent behavior with sample logs
* Confirmed OpenRouter + free model integration is functioning

### **6. Planned Enhancements (for roadmap)**

* Add async LLM calls for improved throughput
* Add persistent run history storage (SQLite or JSONL)
* Add web-based UI dashboard for triage results
* Add log ingestion presets for common formats (Nginx, AWS, Syslog, etc.)
* Add security scanning features for audit logs
* Add streaming responses for long LLM outputs
* Containerization with Docker
* Add lightweight user auth for the API

---

## **🚧 Blockers / Issues**

* Need to add better runtime error resilience for malformed logs
* Current local models not yet integrated (future task)
* Some responses may need output truncation or formatting normalization

---

## **🧠 Notes / Ideas**

* Consider adding an embedding-based similarity engine to cluster related log events
* Could integrate a vector store to analyze logs historically
* A future web dashboard could position this as a “miniature internal SRE assistant”
* Might add Chain-of-Thought or multi-step reasoning features with open models

---

## **🔄 Plan for Tomorrow**

* Add async versions of triage functions
* Improve model selection logic and environment variable config
* Begin implementing a minimal web UI (optional)
* Add Postman collection or API client examples
* Expand test coverage to API and error handling paths

---

## **AI Summary (For ChatGPT Review Tomorrow)**

**Goals:** Continue Phase 1; improve API + CLI; refine architecture
**Accomplishments:** Built full FastAPI layer, improved CLI, unified triage pipeline, added docs, added tests
**Blockers:** Log formatting edge cases, need more robust error handling
**Notes:** Explore embeddings + clustering; UI dashboard; async execution coming next
